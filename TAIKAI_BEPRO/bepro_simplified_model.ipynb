    ">Bepro Network is a decentralized marketplace and system that connects developers with operators and anyone looking to build open-source development repositories.

    "There are eight mechanisms in which an agent can interact with an instance of BePro Network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `createBounty`: open issues on the platform in exchange for ERC20 Tokens to developers;\n",
    "2. `cancelBounty`: cancel the issue that was first created. If the bounty is canceled after the draft time period, the operation comes with a penalty of X% of the bounty;\n",
    "3. `createPullRequest`: developers notify the operators they are solving the issue published;  \n",
    "4. `cancelPullRequest`: developers notify the operators they are no longer solving the issue;\n",
    "5. `markPullRequestAsReady`: developers notify the operators they solved the problem and are for the merge proposals;\n",
    "6. `createBountyProposal`: any council, holder of 25M $BEPRO, can make a merge proposal for a resolution mechanism for a bounty. In case the same proposal is passed through the curation proccess, the council member receives X% of the bounty;\n",
    "7. `disputeProposal`: council member contests a merge proposal with a new one;\n",
    "8. `refuseBountyProposal`: bounty creator can refuse the bounty proposals (what is his power regarding this?);\n",
    "9. `closeBounty`: proccess that takes place after the rewards are distributed to every agent accountable (including the treasury) and the bounty NFT is minted;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fees\n",
    "1. `Network Fee`: (5% currently): of the total bounty prize that goes to a treasury address for each bounty created on the system;\n",
    "2. `Curator Fee` (3% currently): of the total bounty prize that goes to the Curator member that proposes the Mergee Distribution/Request;\n",
    "3. `Cancel Fee` (1% currently): of the total bounty prize that goes to a treasury address when a bounty is canceled;\n",
    "4. Study the possibility of new parameters and dynamic changes to the existing ones;\n",

    "## Limitations and simplifications of this model\n",
    "* **Bounties are either created or, canceled or closed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Usage of the white-label by an operator doesn't require staking $BEPRO**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **All bounties will be payed in $BEPRO** instead of any ERC20 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gas fees are counted as 0 or irrelevant for the network agents**;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User _behavior_ has not been modeled**. User actions are derived from the history of events of the Bepro instance being analyzed;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One timestep in the simulation will be equal to 24 hours**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pull requests and merge proccess are abstracted**, i.e., every time a bounty is closed, the model assumes the proccess of dispute and curation has been made successfuly"
